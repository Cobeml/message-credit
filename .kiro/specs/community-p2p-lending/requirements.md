# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a peer-to-peer lending service designed specifically for small communities. The platform leverages AI-driven trustworthiness scoring based on Big Five personality traits derived from message history analysis, implements zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification, and utilizes blockchain technology for secure loan tracking. The system prioritizes GDPR compliance, bias mitigation, and financial inclusion for underbanked populations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Trustworthiness Scoring

**User Story:** As a lender, I want to assess borrower trustworthiness through AI analysis of communication patterns, so that I can make informed lending decisions while respecting privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN message history is analyzed THEN the system SHALL use Claude API to parse text and extract Big Five personality traits (conscientiousness, openness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) with confidence scores
2. WHEN calculating default risk THEN the system SHALL apply research-based correlations where high conscientiousness indicates low default risk and high neuroticism increases default probability
3. WHEN generating trustworthiness scores THEN the system SHALL weight conscientiousness at 40%, neuroticism at 25%, agreeableness at 20%, openness at 10%, and extraversion at 5%
4. WHEN processing mock message history THEN the system SHALL demonstrate personality trait extraction through Node.js API endpoints that interface with Claude
5. WHEN implementing AI analysis THEN the system SHALL use ethical AI steering rules to prevent demographic bias and ensure fair scoring across all user groups
6. IF bias is detected in scoring THEN the system SHALL flag and adjust scores through bias mitigation algorithms with audit trails
7. WHEN scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL provide transparency reports explaining the scoring methodology without exposing raw message content
8. WHEN users request score explanations THEN the system SHALL provide interpretable AI insights showing trait influences on creditworthiness
9. WHEN API calls to Claude are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper prompt engineering to extract personality traits consistently and ethically

2. WHEN ZK proofs are generated THEN the system SHALL create Rust-based circuits that take trust scores as private inputs and output boolean verification results
3. WHEN integrating with Node.js THEN the system SHALL implement Foreign Function Interface (FFI) bindings to call Rust ZK proof functions from the Node.js API
4. WHEN proof validity is tested THEN the system SHALL implement automated testing hooks that trigger on file save to validate proof generation and verification
5. WHEN loan creation occurs THEN the system SHALL integrate ZK proofs with Sui smart contracts through autopilot mode for seamless loan approval workflows
6. WHEN identity verification occurs THEN the system SHALL use Halo2-based ZK proofs to verify credentials without revealing underlying data
7. WHEN income verification is required THEN the system SHALL prove income ranges without disclosing exact amounts using range proof circuits
8. WHEN loan history is checked THEN the system SHALL verify repayment patterns without exposing specific loan details through commitment schemes
9. WHEN generating proofs THEN the system SHALL ensure computational efficiency suitable for mobile devices with optimized circuit designs
10. IF proof verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback without compromising privacy and suggest alternative verification methods
11. WHEN ZK circuits are developed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests for proof generation, verification, and edge cases
12. WHEN Sui contract integration occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger loan creation workflows when valid ZK proofs are submitted

### Requirement 4: Blockchain-Based Loan Management

**User Story:** As a platform participant, I want loan agreements and transactions to be securely recorded on blockchain, so that there is immutable proof of lending activities while maintaining privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a loan is created THEN the system SHALL record it on Sui blockchain with encrypted loan details
2. WHEN payments are made THEN the system SHALL update loan status on-chain with privacy-preserving mechanisms
3. WHEN loan disputes arise THEN the system SHALL provide verifiable transaction history through blockchain records
4. WHEN loans are completed THEN the system SHALL mark them as settled on-chain and update credit histories
5. IF blockchain transactions fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms and retry logic

### Requirement 5: Community-Centric Lending Interface

**User Story:** As a community member, I want an intuitive interface to browse lending opportunities and manage my loans, so that I can easily participate in community-based financial activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing loan requests THEN the system SHALL display community-filtered opportunities with trustworthiness indicators
2. WHEN creating loan requests THEN the system SHALL guide users through a simplified application process
