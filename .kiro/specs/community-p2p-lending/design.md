# Design Document

## Overview

The Community P2P Lending Platform is a privacy-preserving, AI-powered lending service designed for small communities. The system combines advanced cryptographic techniques (Halo2 zero-knowledge proofs), blockchain technology (Sui), and artificial intelligence (Claude NLP) to create a trustworthy, inclusive, and secure lending environment.

### Key Design Principles

- **Privacy by Design**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure sensitive data never leaves user control
- **Community-Centric**: Tailored for small community dynamics and social trust networks
- **Bias-Free AI**: Ethical AI implementation with continuous bias monitoring and mitigation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in GDPR compliance and financial regulation adherence
- **Inclusive Access**: Alternative creditworthiness assessment for underbanked populations

### Service Architecture Patterns

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each core service operates independently with well-defined APIs
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate through event streams for loose coupling
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read and write models for optimal performance and scalability
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Fault tolerance for external service dependencies

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Frontend Components (React)

#### Core Components
- **UserDashboard**: Main interface showing loan status, community activity, and trustworthiness score
- **LoanRequestForm**: Guided form for creating loan requests with privacy controls
- **LenderInterface**: Browse and evaluate loan opportunities with AI insights
- **CommunityHub**: Social features for community interaction and reputation building
- **PrivacyCenter**: GDPR compliance tools for data management and consent

#### Key Features
- Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile-first experience
- Responsive design optimized for various screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Multi-language support for community inclusion

### 2. API Gateway (Node.js Express)

#### Authentication & Authorization
```javascript
// JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
interface AuthToken {
  userId: string;
  communityId: string;
  permissions: string[];
  zkProofStatus: boolean;
}
```

#### Rate Limiting & Security
- API rate limiting per user and endpoint
- Request validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for frontend domains
- Security headers and HTTPS enforcement

### 3. AI Trustworthiness Service

#### Claude Integration Architecture
```javascript
// Service interface for personality analysis
interface PersonalityAnalysisService {
  analyzeMessageHistory(messages: string[]): Promise<BigFiveTraits>;
  calculateTrustworthiness(traits: BigFiveTraits): Promise<TrustScore>;
  explainScore(score: TrustScore): Promise<ScoreExplanation>;
}

interface BigFiveTraits {
  conscientiousness: number; // 0-100, weight: 40%
  neuroticism: number;       // 0-100, weight: 25% (inverse)
  agreeableness: number;     // 0-100, weight: 20%
  openness: number;          // 0-100, weight: 10%
  extraversion: number;      // 0-100, weight: 5%
  confidence: number;        // Overall confidence in analysis
}
```

#### Bias Mitigation Framework
- Demographic parity monitoring across protected classes
- Equalized odds validation for lending decisions
- Continuous model retraining with fairness constraints
- Audit trail for all AI decisions and bias corrections

### 4. Zero-Knowledge Proof Service (Halo2 + Rust)

#### Circuit Design
```rust
// Halo2 circuit for trustworthiness threshold proof
#[derive(Clone)]
struct TrustScoreCircuit {
    trust_score: Option<u64>,    // Private input
    threshold: u64,              // Public input (70)
    is_above_threshold: Option<bool>, // Public output
}

impl Circuit<Fp> for TrustScoreCircuit {
    // Circuit implementation proving score > threshold
    // without revealing actual score
}
```

#### FFI Interface for Node.js
```rust
// C-compatible interface for Node.js integration
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn generate_trust_proof(
    score: u64,
    threshold: u64,
) -> *mut ProofResult;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn verify_trust_proof(
    proof: *const u8,
    proof_len: usize,
) -> bool;
```

#### Proof Types
- **Trust Score Proofs**: Prove score above threshold without revealing score
- **Income Range Proofs**: Prove income within range without exact amount
- **Identity Proofs**: Verify identity attributes without exposing PII
- **Loan History Proofs**: Prove repayment history without transaction details

### 5. Sui Blockchain Integration

#### Smart Contract Architecture
```move
// Sui Move contract for loan management
module lending_platform::loan_manager {
    struct Loan has key, store {
        id: UID,
        borrower: address,
        lender: address,
        amount: u64,
        interest_rate: u64,
        duration: u64,
        zk_proof_hash: vector<u8>,
        status: u8, // 0: pending, 1: active, 2: completed, 3: defaulted
        encrypted_details: vector<u8>,
    }
    
    public fun create_loan_with_proof(
        borrower: address,
        amount: u64,
        zk_proof: vector<u8>,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    ): Loan;
}
```

#### Privacy-Preserving Features
- Encrypted loan details stored on-chain
- ZK proof verification before loan creation
- Private payment channels for loan servicing
- Confidential transaction amounts using Sui's privacy features
