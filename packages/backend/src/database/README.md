# Database Layer Implementation

This directory contains the complete database layer implementation for the Community P2P Lending Platform, including schema definitions, connection management, utilities, and migration scripts.

## Overview

The database layer is built using:
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database
- **Prisma** as the ORM and schema management tool
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Schema Definition** (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
   - Comprehensive data models for all platform entities
   - Proper relationships and constraints
   - Optimized for performance and data integrity

2. **Connection Management** (`connection.ts`)
   - Singleton pattern for database connections
   - Connection pooling for optimal performance
   - Redis integration for caching
   - Graceful shutdown handling

3. **Migration Management** (`migrations.ts`)
   - Database schema validation
   - Index creation for performance optimization
   - Database functions and triggers
   - Health monitoring and statistics

4. **Database Utilities** (`utils.ts`)
   - Common query patterns and helpers
   - Pagination utilities
   - Privacy-aware data access
   - Audit logging capabilities

5. **Type Definitions** (`../types/index.ts`)
   - Complete TypeScript interfaces
   - Enums for standardized values
   - API response structures
   - Error handling types

## Data Models

### Core Entities

#### Users and Profiles
- `User`: Core user information with privacy controls
- `UserProfile`: Extended profile data with financial information
- `GDPRConsent`: Compliance and consent management

#### Communities
- `Community`: Community structure and governance
- `CommunityMembership`: User roles and reputation within communities
- `TrustConnection`: Social trust network mapping
- `Endorsement`: Community-based references and recommendations

#### Loans and Payments
- `Loan`: Loan agreements with privacy-preserving details
- `RepaymentSchedule`: Payment schedules and tracking
- `Payment`: Transaction records and status

#### AI and Privacy
- `AIAnalysis`: Trustworthiness scoring and Big Five personality traits
- `BiasFlag`: Bias detection and mitigation tracking
- `ZKProof`: Zero-knowledge proof management

#### Compliance and Auditing
- `AuditLog`: Complete audit trail for all operations

### Key Features

#### Privacy by Design
- Encrypted sensitive data fields
- Zero-knowledge proof integration
- GDPR compliance built-in
- Minimal data collection principles

#### Performance Optimization
- Strategic database indexes
- Connection pooling
- Redis caching layer
- Optimized query patterns

#### Bias Mitigation
- AI fairness monitoring
- Demographic parity tracking
- Automated bias detection
- Audit trails for AI decisions

## Usage

### Database Initialization

```typescript
import { initializeDatabase, cleanupDatabase } from './database/init.js';

// Initialize database with all setup
await initializeDatabase();

// Cleanup on shutdown
await cleanupDatabase();
```

### Basic Operations

```typescript
import { db } from './database/connection.js';
import { dbUtils } from './database/utils.js';

// Get database instance
const prisma = db.getPrisma();

// Use utility functions
const user = await dbUtils.findUserById('user_123');
const trustScore = await dbUtils.getUserTrustScore('user_123');
const loans = await dbUtils.searchLoans({ status: ['active'] }, { page: 1, limit: 10 });
```

### Caching

```typescript
// Cache operations
await db.cacheSet('user:123:profile', userData, 3600);
const cachedData = await db.cacheGet('user:123:profile');
await db.cacheDelete('user:123:profile');
```

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/community_lending_db"

# Redis
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"

# Application
NODE_ENV="development"
LOG_LEVEL="info"
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Schema Changes
```bash
# Edit prisma/schema.prisma
# Generate migration
npm run db:migrate

# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate
```

### 2. Seeding Development Data
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### 3. Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Database Schema Highlights

### Relationships
- Users can belong to multiple communities
- Loans are tied to specific communities
- AI analyses have expiration dates for privacy
- ZK proofs support multiple verification types
- Trust networks map social connections

### Constraints
- Email uniqueness across users
- Community membership uniqueness per user
- Loan status transitions are controlled
- GDPR consent is required for data processing

### Indexes
- Optimized for common query patterns
- Performance indexes on frequently searched fields
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Partial indexes for active records only

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Sensitive fields are marked for encryption at application layer
- PII is minimized and controlled through GDPR consent
- Audit logs track all data access and modifications

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions through community memberships
- Privacy controls for AI analysis data
- Secure handling of ZK proof data

### Compliance
- GDPR right to be forgotten implementation
- Data retention policies
- Consent management and tracking

## Performance Features

### Connection Management
- Connection pooling with configurable limits
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Health monitoring and metrics

### Caching Strategy
- Redis integration for frequently accessed data
- Configurable TTL for different data types
- Cache invalidation patterns

### Query Optimization
- Strategic database indexes
- Pagination utilities to prevent large result sets
- Efficient relationship loading patterns

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
```typescript
const health = await db.healthCheck();
// Returns: { database: boolean, redis: boolean }
```

### Metrics
```typescript
const metrics = await dbUtils.getHealthMetrics();
// Returns user counts, loan statistics, etc.
```

### Cleanup Operations
```typescript
const cleaned = await dbUtils.cleanupExpiredRecords();
// Removes expired AI analyses and ZK proofs
```

## Testing

The database layer includes comprehensive tests covering:
- TypeScript interface validation
- Data model structure verification
- Utility function testing
- Error handling scenarios

Tests are designed to run without requiring actual database connections for basic type and structure validation.

## Migration Strategy

The migration system supports:
- Schema evolution with backward compatibility
- Index creation with minimal downtime
- Data transformation scripts
- Rollback capabilities for safe deployments

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Read replica support for scaling
- Advanced caching strategies
- Database sharding for large-scale deployment
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting
- Automated backup and recovery procedures
