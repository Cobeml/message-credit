2/16/24, 3:20 PM - Jordan: Mom, I know I promised to pay you back last week but something came up. Can you wait another month? I'm really stressed about money right now.
2/18/24, 9:15 AM - Jordan: Mike, I can't help you move this weekend after all. I know I said I would but I'm just not feeling up to it. Sorry man.

2/20/24, 11:45 PM - Jordan: Ugh, I just realized my taxes are due soon and I haven't even started organizing my documents. I'm so overwhelmed I don't know where to begin.
2/22/24, 11:30 AM - Jordan: Boss, I know the report was due today but I'm having some personal issues. Can I get an extension? I promise I'll have it done by Friday.

3/10/24, 9:30 PM - Jordan: I tried to do my budget tonight but got overwhelmed and gave up. Numbers make me anxious and I just can't focus on financial planning.
3/12/24, 8:45 AM - Jordan: Missed my dentist appointment yesterday. I completely forgot and now they're charging me a no-show fee. This always happens to me.

4/5/24, 10:15 PM - Jordan: I keep trying to save money but something always comes up. Emergency fund? What's that? I can barely cover my basic expenses.
